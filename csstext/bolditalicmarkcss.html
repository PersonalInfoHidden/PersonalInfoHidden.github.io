        What is <span class="i">JavaScript?</span><br />
        JavaScript is a powerful programming language originally created by
        Netscape,
        <span class="del"
            >and is supported by Netscape 2.0 and higher, and Explorer 4.0 and
            higher.</span
        >
        It is primarily used to add interactivity and multimedia to web pages.
        Beside the name,
        <span class="mark"
            >JavaScript has nothing to do with Java programming language</span
        >. The fact that the names are similar to each other has led to some
        confusion.
