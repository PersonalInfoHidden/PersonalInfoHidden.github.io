        What is <i>JavaScript?</i><br />
        JavaScript is a powerful programming language originally created by
        Netscape,
        <del
            >and is supported by Netscape 2.0 and higher, and Explorer 4.0 and
            higher.</del
        >
        It is primarily used to add interactivity and multimedia to web pages.
        Beside the name,
        <mark>JavaScript has nothing to do with Java programming language</mark
        >. The fact that the names are similar to each other has led to some
        confusion.
